# Personal Macro Development

I'm trying to understand and also develop custom keyboard shortcuts/macros that will allow me to do certain things faster with single key press or via single keyboard shortcut.

### LuaMacros

This is the first thing I've tried and learned about, and it's great not bad but probably not the best one when you have a lot of macros. In web dev terms it can't scale very well.

### ToDo

[x] Understand and use LuaMacros
[ ] Understand and use QMK

So next, I'm going to try QMK and create macros or similar functions with QMK. Until I try and learn QMK I'll keep going with LuaMacros. End goal of this project is to create a basic application with a local web interface that will let you create macros etc. but if this is already done by someone else I won't do it.

This is just fun project/goal for now.
